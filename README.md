About Me  

I am just another human who happened to walk from Mexico to Canada in one summer. It took 146 days and 2,668 miles of walking to complete. But I did it.

This section needs to say more about my ability to write code. I am not sure what to write. But I think that writing something random is totally okay. I feel bored doing this. It is quite strange.
